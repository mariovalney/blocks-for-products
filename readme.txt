A plugin to add support for Gutenberg on product pages.

== Description ==

Add support for Gutenberg on product pages.

[WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/ "Install it first, of course") is a awesome plugin used by 5+ million WordPress websites to create e-commerce.

It's awesome and we love it but for now they [do not support](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/20201#issuecomment-391739963) the new WordPress block editor.

So now you can use the best of the worlds: WooCommerce product settings on classic editor and product description with block editor.

= How to Use =

Easily and quickly!

Just activate "Blocks for Products" and you will be able to change from Classic Editor to Gutenberg.

= Translations =

You can [translate Blocks for Products](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/blocks-for-products) to your language.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

No problem, you can click on "Use Classic Editor" to use Classic Editor.
